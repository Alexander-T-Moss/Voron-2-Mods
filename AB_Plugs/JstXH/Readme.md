## AB Motor Plug (Jst-XH)
##### Credits:
- Myself xD

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation
- Supports are needed (Check Pictures below)

###### Bom:
- M3x8
- M3 T-Nut
- JST-XH 4-Pin

###### Description:
- LDO motor steppers comes with that prewired steppers (which doesn't have a plug), so this is exactly for making a "plug" for them that looks clean and beautifull.
- I recommend to use the [Misumi Cable Clip](https://github.com/Ramalama2/Voron-2-Mods/tree/main/Misumi_Cable_Clip "Misumi Cable Clip") to hide the wires for the left motor!
