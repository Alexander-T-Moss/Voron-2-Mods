    Assembly:
  </summary>
- Desolder the headphone plug from the Hdmi to CSI Pcb, it will be in the way. Thats easy anyway.<br>
- Use some heatsinks on every component of the CM4, see my pics! I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00XQ9AZ8Y">EC360 Thermal Glue</a>, to glue any sort of heatsinks on the components! The CM4 gets a lot hotter by itself as an normal PI4!<br>
- The rest is pretty self explanatory! Check the Pictures in the Image directory and the Bom-Picture!<br>

    Description:
  </summary>
- Why:<br>
- I wanted the smalles high quality camera in my voron printer!<br>
- The time i designed this, there was only a CM4 compatible Arducam IMX477 Mini, but not a PI4 Compatible one.<br>
- The new Arducam i linked above, is the newest revision, that is PI4 Compatible either.<br>
- I wanted additionally a fast and cool NVME drive, including a nice cool case where i have an HDMI plug for my arducam. Since a CSI-Cable is not routable in the chain.<br></details>
