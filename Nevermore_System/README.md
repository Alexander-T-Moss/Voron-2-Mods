## Nevermore System
##### Credits:
- 0ndsk4, who forced me to make a RFL-35 Version :-)
- Basically i gaved up wasting my time on the Duo, and thought it's a better idea to make a single, which you can combine to a Duo or a Tripple or Quad, or whatever your imaginations allow!
- If anyone want to help me: Waste his time and design something for this here, make adapters or whatever, message me happily on discord, im always open for everything!

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom:
- 4x M3x12 BHCS
- 4x M3 Inserts
- 4x 6x3 Magnets

###### Description:
- Work in Progress!
- This here is far from any final, it's just a beginning. There are no Pictures yet, or anything i want to put my time in.
- In short, everything is based on this one Fan Housing, i released already. There will be adapters for everything:
- 1. Bed Fan Adapter, to use as Bed-Fans
- 2. Nevermore Filter Adapter in Single Short, Single Long, Single XXL / Duo Long, Duo XXL
- 3. Recirculator: At the top the air gets sucked and pushed to under the bed again. (A picture will explain this soon better)
- 4. Mounts Adapters for everything.
- The main usecase for everyone, is to use 4 of this Fans under the bed as a Nevermore. Duo (2x) in the middle on the bed and Singles on the 2 sides of the bed. This will get released as first anyway. On Weekend probably.

###### Pictures:
- Later

###### CAD:
- Im Always providing CAD Files for everything, this here won't change. Just will release them later this time, cause im not done yet boys. If someone wants to help, message me, i will send them.
