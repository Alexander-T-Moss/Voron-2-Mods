## Misumi LED Corner Clips
##### Credits:
- Eddie from the Voron-Team (From his awesome Misumi Led Clips)
- You get his LED Clips in Discord, he didn't published it to Voronusermods sadly :-(

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports

###### Bom:
- Nothing

###### Description:
- Corners for the awesome Led Clips from eddie, to hide the wires and one blanklet.
- No need to cut or recable your wiring, this clips are meant to hide already existing cables. You will find out how it works once you print and try it :-)
- You can modify their Z-Size as you need, simply scale it.
- Don't scale below 75% and above 150%. Below 75% the wires will probably not fit on the exit. And above 150% it will just have an big wire exit and will look weird.
