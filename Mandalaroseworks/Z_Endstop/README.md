    Description:
  </summary>
This is a Z-Endstop for a Bed with MRW Kinematics<br>
This Endstop requires more Force as the normal Voron Endstop. It has the benefit of:<br>
1. Much less risk that the Pin stucks!<br>
2. Nozzle need to trigger the Pin with more Force, means oozing will be less of an issue!<br>
3. Fits perfectly a Kinematics Bed without having an extremely long Pin that wiggles!<br>
