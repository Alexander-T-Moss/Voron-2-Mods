#### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!<br>

#### Bom:
- 2x M2x10 Self-tapping Screw<br>

#### Description:
- All Dinclips/Brackets are compatible with their original counterparts. The hole distances are the same.
- To make the M3 ones compatible with your mounts, you just have to drill up your holes to 3mm for the M3 screws instead of those Self-Tapping M2 Screws.
- Stiffer generic Din Bracket (same as the one for the pi, but it sits much tighter on the din rail. I found the voron ones a bit wobbly on the din rails) You can use this bracket for everything else.
